## We have used:
- Ngrok and Flask as a server.
- Twilio as whatsapp agent.
- Gemini API for generating response.
- Flask App as API for Request/Response model.

## Steps
1. Create free account in [Twilio](https://console.twilio.com/), and [Ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/).
2. Open twilio console, register your whatsapp number. 
3. Create Flask App.
4. Run Ngrok on same port as Flask App. 
5. Setup Ngrok URL in Whatsapp Sandbox (in Twilio console).
6. Deploy the Flask App at server  like I did (https://chatbot-izuy.onrender.com/whatsapp) 
6 . Done, chatbot is activated!!

## Usage:
- Clone my repository.
- Open CMD in working directory.
- Run following command.

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- `app.py` is the Flask API which handles Request/Response of ChatBOT.
- To run this script follow this command.
  ``` 
     app.py
  ```
